## 5th workshop on Containers and new orchestration paradigms for isolated environments in HPC (CANOPIE-HPC) at Supercomputing 2023

### Program chairs:

* Alberto Madonna, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre
* Laurie Stephey, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab

* Shane Canon, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
* Andrew Younge, Sandia National Labs

CANOPIE-HPC is a workshop focusing on containerization, virtualization, and
other methods to implement user-defined, bring-your-own, or isolated software
environments. Submissions will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be
published in IEEE  Computer Society.

### Important Dates

* Submission opens:    June 1, 2023
* Submission closes (hard deadline- no extensions):    August 18, 2023
* Decisions:    September 8, 2023
* Camera ready deadline:    September 29, 2023
* Workshop date:    November 13, 2023

**Note: Items are due at 23:59 “anywhere on Earth” on the specified date. Specifically, this is 23:59 IDLW, i.e., UTC–12:00.**

### Overview

The ongoing revolution enabled via containerization, virtualization, and new
orchestration models has dramatically changed how applications and services are
delivered and managed across the computing industry. This revolution has
established a new ecosystem of tools and techniques with new, flexible and
agile approaches, and continues to gain traction in the HPC community. In
addition to HPC-optimized container runtimes, emerging technologies like
Kubernetes create a new set of opportunities and challenges. While adoption is
growing, questions regarding best practices, foundational concepts, tools, and
standards remain. Our goal is to promote the adoption of these tools and
introspect the impact of this new ecosystem on HPC use cases. This workshop
serves as a key venue for presenting late-breaking research, sharing
experiences and best practices, and fostering collaboration in this field. Our
fifth workshop iteration will continue to emphasize real-world experiences and
challenges in adopting and optimizing these new approaches for HPC.

### Scope

The scope of this workshop is to better understand and improve paradigms around
containerization, virtualization and orchestration for HPC use cases. The most
well-known approaches are containers and virtualization, but anything to
further these goals is welcome. Topics include but are not limited to:

* Container runtimes, virtual machine implementations, and other related technologies
* Perspectives from container framework developers and  maintainers
* System and architecture portability
* Scientific reproducibility, including FAIR considerations 
* Experience reports from users, developers, and system administrators
* Lessons from exascale
* HPC in the cloud and/or cloud in the HPC
* GPUs, accelerators, proprietary interconnects, and other hardware considerations
* Security considerations when adopting container technologies, including zero trust models
* Container and virtual machine image management, including distribution and archiving
* Workflows, including interaction between traditional HPC applications and containerized workflows or edge services
* Performance and scaling studies with containers and/or VMs
* Orchestration, scheduling, and/or resource management of jobs and microservices
* New interaction techniques such as web apps (Jupyter, Rstudio, etc.)
* Community standards, including OCI 
* Role of containerization in DevOps (ex: Gitlab CI/CD) 
* Efforts to provide and curate containers
* Improving container user experience
* Future of containers (ex: web assembly, portability) 
* Perspectives on container outreach- convincing native application users/devs to make the jump

### Workshop format

Although in the past several years CANOPIE-HPC has followed a more traditional
format, based on SC22 attendee feedback we plan to adjust the format for SC23
to include additional lightning talks, panels, and open discussion. The content
of technical sessions will be driven by the mix of accepted submissions curated
by the program chairs. We will offer two submission tracks: one for full paper
submissions, and one for lightning talks. 

Full paper submissions will receive at least 3 peer reviews in the SC23
submission system on the basis of scientific validity, impact to the field,
reproducibility, and opportunity for interactive discussion at the workshop.
The program committee will discuss the submissions and their reviews over a
conference call moderated by the program chairs; final proceedings will be
selected by majority vote of the committee. As in all previous years, accepted
submissions will be published by the IEEE Computer Society for inclusion in the
IEEE Digital Library. Artifacts for reproducibility (digital archives of code,
README instructions, images, etc.) will be a significant factor in paper
acceptance into the workshop. Further details are available in the “Submission
procedure” section below.

For lightning talks, participants can submit an abstract that will be reviewed
by the program committee. Our lightning talk track is meant to showcase demos,
exploratory and late-breaking work, pain-points or shortcomings in current
container/virtualization technologies, and projects that may not be fleshed-out
enough to warrant a paper submission. We especially encourage lightning talk
submissions from early career participants and people who are relatively new to
the world of containers/virtualization.

### Diversity and inclusivity

Similarly to the broader field of HPC, the organizers recognize concerns with
diversity and inclusion in CANOPIE-HPC. We want to continue to improve
diversity and inclusion at leadership, program committee, and participation
levels.  The expanded lightning talks session is intended to lower the barrier
to entry in the workshop and involve more early-career and non-expert
participants. We also plan to include an open discussion section to invite
additional audience questions and participation.  Virtual attendance (another
opportunity for inclusion) will be guaranteed. We’ll make sure we have someone
from the program community monitoring the chat throughout the workshop to
address any issues or questions from our virtual attendees.  

### Submission procedure

Accepted manuscripts will be published in IEEE Computer Society.

Upload your paper in PDF format. Papers must use the new [ACM proceedings
templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and the CCS2012 guide.
Manuscript length must
be between 6 and 12 pages, including references and figures.

We enthusiastically welcome original, high-quality submissions within the scope
above. These may describe complete studies; work-in-progress research; position
papers on controversial, emerging, or hot topics; state of the practice; or any
other manuscript the authors believe should be included in the CANOPIE-HPC
program. We encourage submissions from academia, industry, government, and/or
any other type of institution.  Each manuscript will be assessed using peer
review by program committee members (or outside reviewers, if needed) on the
basis of scientific validity, impact to the field, reproducibility,
inclusivity, and opportunity for useful and lively discussion at the workshop.
Review will be single-masked; i.e., reviewers will know authors’ identities,
but not vice versa. Authors should not anonymize their manuscripts. Each
manuscript submission will be checked using anti-plagiarism software and can
expect to have at least 3 reviews.

In conjunction with the SC Reproducibility Initiative, submissions should be as
transparent as possible regarding all methods. Submissions are also expected to
provide reproducibility artifacts such as reproduction instructions, source
code, build recipes, and/or container images. These should be included as part
of the submission in the form of 
[Artifact Description/Artifact Evaluation appendices](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-appendices-badges/),
which adhere to an established format adopted by SC23.

The program committee will discuss the submissions and their reviews and select
the program over a video conference meeting. Submissions will be assessed
as-is, with no expectation of substantive revision after peer review, though
some submissions may be accepted conditional on specified changes
(“shepherded”).
